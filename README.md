# Potion Stacking

Potions take up WAY too much space in the inventory. With this mod, all types of potions will stack up to 16! Modded potions are also supported :)

To keep splash and lingering potions balanced, there is now a 1 second cooldown between uses.

### Future Plans:
- Backport this mod as far as I resonably can
- NeoForge Port
- Add config file to disable thrown potion cooldown

This mod is inspired by the [Stackable Potions](https://modrinth.com/mod/stackablepotions) mod made by [CursedFlames](https://modrinth.com/user/CursedFlames). However, unlike some [other mods I've made](https://modrinth.com/user/proxi), this is not a port. It's a recreation from the ground up. All assets and code used are my own.
